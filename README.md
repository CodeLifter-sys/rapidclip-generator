# **RapidClip**

**RapidClip** is a project that automates the creation of short videos, ideal for platforms such as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Kwai. The current version allows you to generate complete videos from a given topic by combining narration, dynamic images, visual effects, synchronized subtitles, detailed process logging, and final video assembly with animated transitions.

## **Running RapidClip**

### **Using Docker**

RapidClip can run inside a Docker container, providing an isolated and easy-to-setup environment. For detailed instructions, refer to [README.DOCKER.md](README.DOCKER.md).

### **Local Setup (without Docker)**

If you prefer running RapidClip directly on your machine, follow these steps:

**1. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Generate your video:**

**With ElevenLabs TTS (Recommended):**
```bash
python src/main.py --theme "Space Curiosities (a single curiosity)" \
  --language "en" \
  --voice_id "CstacWqMhJQlnfLPxRG4" \
  --max_duration 60 \
  --tts_service elevenlabs
```

**With OpenAI TTS:**
```bash
python src/main.py --theme "Technology Curiosities (a single curiosity)" \
  --language "en" \
  --max_duration 60 \
  --tts_service openai \
  --openai_tts_model "tts-1-hd" \
  --openai_tts_voice "onyx"
```

### **Parameters:**
- `--theme`: The topic for the video script.
- `--language`: Script and narration language.
- `--tts_service`: Choose between `elevenlabs` (default) or `openai`.
- `--voice_id`: Required if using ElevenLabs.
- `--openai_tts_model`: OpenAI TTS model (default: `tts-1-hd`).
- `--openai_tts_voice`: Voice selection for OpenAI TTS (default: `alloy`).
- `--max_duration`: Maximum audio duration in seconds.

### **Generated Output:**

Your generated files will appear in the `output/` folder:
- **Audio (`.mp3`)**: Narration audio.
- **Subtitles (`.srt`)**: Synchronized subtitles.
- **Logs (`process.log`)**: Detailed logs of the process.
- **Final Video (`_final.mp4`)**: Rendered video with subtitles and transitions (resolution: 1080x1920).

### **Subtitle Generation Approach:**
- **Punctuation Tokenization**: Preserves original punctuation.
- **Word-Punctuation Alignment**: Ensures correct punctuation placement.
- **Cue Segmentation**: Subtitles segmented by character and word limits for readability and synchronization.
